  # This is used to autocalculate many domain-based values of your Cloud Foundry.
  # Changing it will have widespread changes throughout the installation. If you change
  # this, make sure to audit the domains available in your system org, as well as
  # the shared domains.
  # (e.g. bosh-lite.com)
  base_domain: 10.213.13.41.sslip.io

  # Used to scale out the number of VMs performing various jobs. Here are some commonly
  # scaled instance groups, but all can be used, following the pattern
  # `<instance_group_name>_instances`

  # To ensure that CF apps have access to talk to their services, we've added a default
  # Application Security Group called `services`. It needs a list of networks that you
  # wish to allow applications to access.

  # To ensure that CF apps can talk to other CF applications, we've added a default
  # Application Security Group to allow access to the CF public IPs. This property
  # needs a list of all the public IPs your Cloud Foundry domains are in front of
  # Try `dig @8.8.8.8 +short myapp.<domain>` for each of your CF domains to get a full
  # list.

  # This tells various CF components to skip strict
  # SSL certificate validation when connecting over HTTPS

  # This is the port that CF will advertise the
  # doppler/loggregator endpoint on. Usually either
  # 443 or 4443, depending on how your load balancer
  # handles WebSockets
  #logger_port: 443

  # This is the domain to be used for the `default-tcp' routing
  # group. It should point to a load balancer that lives in front
  # of the `tcp-router' VMs (or directly to the `tcp-router' VM
  # if load balancers are not used). Any apps pushed to CF using
  # TCP traffic instead of HTTP should use this domain.
